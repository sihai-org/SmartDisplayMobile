# Claude Code Development Log

## Project Status: iOS App Successfully Running ✅

**Last Updated:** 2025-09-08

### Current Achievement
- ✅ Flutter app successfully built and running on iPhone 16 Plus simulator
- ✅ Clean Architecture foundation implemented
- ✅ Core navigation and UI framework working
- ✅ Material 3 theming applied

### Build Configuration
```bash
# Successful iOS launch command:
flutter run -d "7B8C93DB-4AAE-4A95-8676-3C8B28D75BAF"

# Build time: 28.4s
# Sync time: 93ms
# DevTools available at: http://127.0.0.1:9100?uri=http://127.0.0.1:50951/fxIlYmXtiGk=/
```

### Dependencies Status
**Currently Active:**
- flutter_riverpod: ^2.4.9 (state management)
- go_router: ^12.1.3 (navigation)
- mobile_scanner: ^3.5.6 (QR scanning)
- cryptography: ^2.5.0 (encryption)
- freezed_annotation: ^2.4.1 (data classes)
- json_annotation: ^4.8.1 (JSON serialization)
- equatable: ^2.0.5 (equality comparison)

**Temporarily Disabled for iOS Compatibility:**
```yaml
# BLE Communication (temporarily disabled for iOS testing)
# flutter_reactive_ble: ^5.3.1

# Secure Storage (temporarily disabled for iOS testing)  
# flutter_secure_storage: ^9.0.0
```

### Issues Resolved
1. **win32 Package Conflict**: flutter_secure_storage was pulling in win32 package which caused iOS build failures
2. **BLE Package Issues**: flutter_reactive_ble had Swift Protobuf deprecation warnings that prevented iOS builds

### Next Steps for Full Implementation
1. **Re-enable BLE Support**: Find iOS-compatible BLE package or update flutter_reactive_ble
2. **Re-enable Secure Storage**: Find iOS-compatible secure storage solution
3. **Implement Core Features**: 
   - QR code scanning functionality
   - BLE device connection
   - Wi-Fi provisioning workflow
   - Secure key exchange (X25519 ECDH + AES-GCM)

### Testing Commands
```bash
# Clean and rebuild
flutter clean && flutter pub get

# Run on iOS simulator
flutter run -d "7B8C93DB-4AAE-4A95-8676-3C8B28D75BAF"

# Run on Chrome (web - working)
flutter run -d chrome

# Run on macOS (pending test)
flutter run -d macos
```

### Known Working Platforms
- ✅ iOS Simulator (iPhone 16 Plus)
- ✅ Chrome Web Browser
- ⏳ macOS Desktop (not tested)
- ⏳ Android (not tested)

### Git Status
- Repository: SmartDisplayMobile
- All core architecture files committed
- iOS build configuration working
- Ready for Phase 2 development (core functionality implementation)
